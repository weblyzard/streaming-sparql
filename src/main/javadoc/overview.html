  Provides a robust, incremental processing of streaming results received from SPARQL servers. The {@link StreamingResultSet} iterator yields results as they are received from the server.

  <h2>Example code:</h2>

  <pre>
  s = StreamingQueryExecutor.getResultSet("http://dbpedia.org/sparql", "SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE { ?s ?p ?o. } LIMIT 5")
  while (s.hasNext()) {
          System.out.println("Tupel " + s.getRowNumber() + ": " + s.next())
  }
  </pre>
